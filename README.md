# Sketching and Prototyping

## Part A: Sketches

### 1. Scan/Photo of Sketches
![Sketsa 1](img/img1-resize.jpg)
![Sketsa 2](img/img2-resize.jpg)

### 2. Version Differences

#### Solution 1
- Wrap the thumbnail images and add the scrollbar (swipeable for mobile version)
- Thumbnail images is next to the current image

#### Solution 2
- Same as solution 1, but the thumbnail images is under the current image (DESKTOP VERSION)
- Autoscroll (auto change current image) every few seconds
- rearrange the navigation menu, add swipe-from-left function to open the menu, and add close button to close the menu (MOBILE VERSION)

#### Solution 3
- remove the mini-thumbnails
- add prev/next button (DESKTOP)
- if clicked on any image, a fullscreen image display will appear

### 3. Selected Sketch
```
Solution 2, because :
- easy to open menu on mobile with swipe function
- auto scroll images will attract the user's attention to not skip all of images
```

### 4. Design Rationale
```
In assignment-1, i've contextual inquiry with the user.
she has trouble to view the picture, especially the last pictures whose position is far below.
she clicked the 'view' button several times but like no feedback.
```

## Part B: Assumptions
### 1. Hardware

- Input device : mouse, keyboard

Mobile :
- Screen resolution 720x1280 or higher, with 16:9 aspect ratio
- Input device : touchscreen
```
### 2. Users
```
Beginner to familiar with web browser
Should be familiar with desktop & mobile
Age : 12-50 years
```
